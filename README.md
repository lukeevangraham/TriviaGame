Deployed at: https://lukeevangraham.github.com/TriviaGame

With this app, I created a travel-themed trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 

## Using the app
This app contains trivia questions with multiple choice options.

The player has a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

The game ends when the timer runs out or the player selects 'Done'. The page reveals the number of questions they answered correctly and incorrectly.

The player cannot select more than one answer per question.
